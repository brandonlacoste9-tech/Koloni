# AdGenXAI Assets - Liquid Gradient Backgrounds

## Required Images

To complete the liquid 3D background implementation, please download high-quality fluid gradient images from:

**Source**: https://www.ls.graphics/free/fluid-gradient-backgrounds

### Required Files:

1. **liquid-hero-1.webp** - Primary hero background (blue/purple/pink theme)
2. **liquid-hero-2.webp** - Secondary hero background (alternative gradient)
3. **liquid-hero-3.webp** - Tertiary hero background (for rotation/variety)

### Image Specifications:

- **Format**: WebP (for optimal performance)
- **Dimensions**: 
  - Desktop: 1920x1080px minimum
  - Mobile: 1080x1920px (portrait orientation)
- **Color Palette**: 
  - Primary: Electric Blue (#2d5ff7)
  - Secondary: Purple (#8b5cf6)
  - Accent: Pink (#ec4899)
  - Additional: Cyan (#06b6d4)
- **Style**: Fluid, liquid, 3D gradient with smooth blends
- **Quality**: High resolution, smooth gradients, no banding

### Mobile Variants (Optional but Recommended):

For optimal mobile performance, also download portrait-oriented versions:
- **liquid-hero-mobile.webp** - Optimized for mobile viewport

### How to Add Images:

1. Download 3-5 fluid gradient backgrounds from ls.graphics
2. Convert to WebP format if not already (using tools like Squoosh.app)
3. Optimize file size (target: < 300KB per image)
4. Rename according to the convention above
5. Place in this directory (`src/assets/`)

### Placeholder Note:

The HTML and CSS have been implemented to work with these images. Once you add the images to this directory, they will automatically be used in the hero section and throughout the site.

### Alternative Sources:

If ls.graphics is unavailable, you can also get similar fluid gradients from:
- Unsplash (search for "fluid gradient abstract")
- Gradienta.io
- Create custom gradients using Figma or Adobe Illustrator

**Note**: The implementation is complete and waiting for these image assets. All code references point to these filenames.
